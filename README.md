My name is Irene (pronounced /ee-deh-neh/, she/her/hers). I am a scientist passionate about Cosmology, outreach and diversity. My work currently focuses on studying the afterglow light from the Big Bang to learn more about the very beginning of the Universe and the subsequent distribution of dark matter across cosmic time.
